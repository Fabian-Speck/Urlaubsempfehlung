## Project for the module Web-Programming in the course WWI23INT at the DHBW Karlsruhe

### Group members:
Fabian Speck

### Distribution of the workload: 
Everything was created by Fabian Speck (obviously).

### Topic:
The application is a tool that helps for vacation planning. The target group of the project are German speakers, therefore the German title and input parameters. 

Based on the input values, the user is shown a suitable vacation destination together with a short description. Some parameters such as budget and approximate travel duration must be met for the destination to be displayed. Other parameters such as the number of children do not play a decisive role in the calculation of a suitable vacation destination, but must also be filled. 

A suitable vacation destination is always displayed, the default value is “Balkonien”.

### Technical requirements:
There was a requirement that user inputs already made should be saved in local storage automatically so that they are not lost when the browser is refreshed. This requirement has been met.

### User instructions:
The use of VisualStudioCode is recommended when using this application. The reason for this is that the free extension “Live Server” from “Ritwick Dey” is required for an error-free execution of the application. This can be found and installed in VisualStudioCode under the section “Extensions”.

After you have opened the project in VisualStudioCode and installed the extension, you can open the HTML page by right-clicking on the “index.html” file in the VisualStudioCode Explorer. Then click on “Open with Live Server”. The page will now open in the browser.

The page appears. On it you will find the following input fields:
1. Budget pro Person in €
2. Reisedauer in Tagen
3. Personenanzahl
4. Davon Kinder
5. Bevorzugte Reiseart
6. Sicherheit im Urlaubsland
7. Bevorzugtes Klima

Fill in the fields as you wish and confirm by clicking on the button “Vorschläge anzeigen”. The result will then be displayed as a pop-up message.

Each field must be filled, only numerical inputs are allowed/possible in the fields 1-4.

### Safe travel!
